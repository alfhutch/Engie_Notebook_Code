Gmail To PDF
============

A helpful collection of Google Apps Script utilities which allow you to
painlessly transform Gmail messages into PDFs.

This handles all of the heavy-lifting needed to preserve all attachments,
inline-images, remote images, backgrounds, etc. Also included are a few helpful
methods for creating virtual queues within your Gmail labels, using either
unread status or starred status as a signifier.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can either open the [example project][2], create a copy, and
modify it to your liking, or you can create a new [Google Apps Script][1]
project and add [GmailUtils][3] and [DriveUtils][4] as libraries by going to
**_Resources_ > _Libraries..._** and entering the following project IDs:

* `MsE3tErxE9G0z6EMfGmUGqVVaKzeOjMwH`
* `MUDdULBfiLdgEZ13bA9paOlVaKzeOjMwH`

Alternatively, you can import GmailUtils.gs or DriveUtils.gs into your own
project and access the library directly with no name spacing.

## Example Usage

Iterate through all starred messages with the label 'Expenses' (up to 5 messages
per call), convert each to a PDF, and save them to Google Drive, then unstar
each message after archival.

```javascript
function saveExpenses() {
  GmailUtils.processStarred('label:Expenses', 5, function(message) {

    // create a pdf of the message
    var pdf = GmailUtils.messageToPdf(message);

    // prefix the pdf filename with a date string
    pdf.setName(GmailUtils.formatDate(message, 'yyyyMMdd - ') + pdf.getName());

    // save the converted file to the 'Expenses' folder within Google Drive
    DriveUtils.getFolder('Expenses').createFile(pdf);

    // signal that we are done with this email and it will be marked as read
    return true;
  });
}
```

Convert the 10 most recent unread messages in the "promotions" category into a
single pdf, mark them as read, and email the digest to yourself.

```javascript
function unreadPromotionsDigest() {
  var to = Session.getActiveUser().getEmail(),
      subject = 'Latest promotional emails',
      body = "here's your unread promotional emails:",
      messages = [];

  // limit this to 10 threads (may be more than 10 messages)
  GmailUtils.processUnread('category:promotions', 10, function(message) {
    messages.push(message);
    return true;
  });

  // convert the group of messages into a single pdf
  var pdf = GmailUtils.messageToPdf(messages, {filename: 'recent_promos.pdf'});

  // email the converted document
  GmailApp.sendEmail(to, subject, body, {attachments: [pdf]});
}
```
